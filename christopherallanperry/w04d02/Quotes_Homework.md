# Express Views Lab

## Introduction

Your task is to make an app capturing your favorite embarrassing quotes – Quotes, Inc. 

## Exercise

- Use EJS to create views for your RESTful routing as follows:
  - An index page and a page to create new quotes with a form
  - One partial for the footer, head, and header that get rendered on each page

- Render forms that submit data back to our Express app to make a full-stack app

#### Deliverable

Do as much as you can – the more complete the better – but bare minimum you should strive to create an index & a new page to POST to your create action.

Do your best to make it stylish, bonus points for pretty.
