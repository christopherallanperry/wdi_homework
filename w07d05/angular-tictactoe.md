You should have already seen the logic of how to play the game earlier on in the course.

You should look up new Angular directives from the documentation and you should style it as much as possible.

## Task

- You don't need to have a back-end server for this app
- Should work out when X or O wins
- Should work out when there is a draw
- Change appearance of the grid when played
- Have a reset button
- You should be able to accomplish things with this file structure:

```
.
├── css
│   └── style.css
├── index.html
└── js
    ├── app.js
    └── tictactoeController.js

2 directories, 4 files
```

## Bonus

If you have already styled everything and you still have lots of time... There are lots of ways to push yourself!
